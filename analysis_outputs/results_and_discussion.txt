SOCIAL MEDIA PRIVACY PERCEPTIONS: QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS RESULTS

RESULTS

This study analyzed survey responses from 127 participants regarding social media privacy perceptions and behavioral intentions. The sample comprised predominantly young adults, with 40.2% aged 18-24 (n = 51) and 37.0% under 18 (n = 47). Gender distribution was balanced with 48.8% female (n = 62) and 48.8% male (n = 62) participants.

Descriptive analysis revealed high levels of surveillance awareness, with 72.4% (n = 92) believing their personal information and online activities are being monitored. Regarding concern about data selling, participants were predominantly "partially worried" (50.4%, n = 64), followed by "worried" (22.0%, n = 28). Notably, 68.5% of participants (n = 87) indicated they have deleted or are considering deleting social media platforms due to privacy concerns.

Chi-square tests examined associations between key variables. The relationship between worry about information selling and deletion intention approached significance, χ²(12, N = 127) = 19.027, p = .088, Cramer's V = 0.137, suggesting a moderate association. A significant association emerged between gender and worry levels, χ²(8, N = 127) = 21.091, p = .007, Cramer's V = 0.228, indicating a medium effect size. Age group showed no significant association with worry levels, χ²(24, N = 127) = 21.656, p = .600.

Missing data was minimal across demographic variables. The study demonstrates substantial privacy concerns among young social media users, with ethical considerations regarding data collection and survey limitations including potential self-selection bias and cross-sectional design constraints.

DISCUSSION

The findings reveal significant privacy concerns among young social media users, with nearly three-quarters believing they are under surveillance and over two-thirds considering or having already reduced platform usage. This high level of privacy awareness contradicts the common assumption that younger users are indifferent to digital privacy, suggesting a generational shift toward greater privacy consciousness.

The moderate association between worry levels and deletion intentions, while not reaching statistical significance (p = .088), indicates a meaningful relationship between privacy concerns and behavioral responses. This near-significant finding suggests that as privacy concerns increase, users become more likely to take protective actions, supporting theoretical models of privacy calculus and behavioral intention.

The significant gender difference in worry levels (p = .007, V = 0.228) represents a notable finding, suggesting that privacy concerns may vary systematically across gender identities. This medium effect size indicates practical significance beyond statistical significance, warranting further investigation into gendered experiences of digital privacy and surveillance.

The absence of age-related differences in privacy concerns challenges assumptions about generational privacy attitudes. Young adults and adolescents showed similar worry patterns, suggesting that privacy concerns may be more universal across age groups than previously thought, at least within this younger demographic.

Study limitations include the cross-sectional design preventing causal inferences, potential self-selection bias toward privacy-conscious participants, and the relatively homogeneous age distribution limiting generalizability. The survey instrument's reliance on self-reported behaviors may introduce social desirability bias, and the convenience sampling method may not represent broader populations.

RECOMMENDATIONS

1. **Policy Development**: Policymakers should recognize young users' sophisticated privacy concerns and develop age-appropriate privacy protections that respect their autonomy while providing meaningful safeguards.

2. **Platform Design**: Social media companies should implement more transparent privacy controls and clearer data usage policies, acknowledging that users across gender and age groups express significant privacy concerns.

3. **Digital Literacy**: Educational programs should focus on empowering users with practical privacy management skills rather than assuming indifference to privacy issues.

4. **Future Research**: Longitudinal studies examining the relationship between privacy concerns and actual behavioral changes, with more diverse age ranges and cultural contexts, would strengthen understanding of digital privacy attitudes.

LIMITATIONS

This study's limitations include potential sampling bias toward privacy-conscious individuals, cross-sectional design constraints, and limited demographic diversity. The survey instrument may not capture the full complexity of privacy decision-making processes.

SUGGESTED ABSTRACTS

Results: "Analysis of 127 young social media users revealed high surveillance awareness (72.4%) and deletion intentions (68.5%), with significant gender differences in privacy concerns (p = .007)."

Implications: "Young social media users demonstrate sophisticated privacy concerns and protective behaviors, challenging assumptions about generational indifference to digital privacy and supporting targeted policy interventions."
